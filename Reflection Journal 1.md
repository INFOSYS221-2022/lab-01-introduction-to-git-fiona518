###What problems did you encounter while you were working on this piece? How did you solve them?
Some of the major problems I encountered is that I had trouble is understanding how to use git and I had issue with downloading git at the beginning. I had to go to the breakout room which causes me to miss out a chunk of the main content so it's hard for me to keep up. I solved it by rewatching the lab recording and follow it step by step. I also communicated with my project member and that really help. I asked questions during the lab session for certain requirement that I don't understand and that helped significantly.
